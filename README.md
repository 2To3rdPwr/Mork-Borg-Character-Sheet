# MorkBorgCharacterSheet

Simple character sheet application for [MÖRK BORG](https://morkborg.com/preview/) for Android (SDK 19+). Mostly built as a way to teach myself all the new fun toys in Android develpment (androidx, LiveData, DataBinding, navigation, ViewPager, etc). Still largely under construction, but almost at minimum viable product.

I'm currently looking for art assets to use. Free icons have worked well enough for development purposes, but they won't stand up to the MÖRK BORG aesthetic once I'm ready to put a bow on things. If you found this somehow and want to contribute art to this for some reason, please reach out to me at jsagehome@gmail.com
